#Tin's Company

###The task was:

OOP PA practice exercise: Workers (by Zsuzsi B.)

Some skilled workers decided to do business together and they started their own company.
There are plumbers, electricians and gas-fitters among them.

All the workers have a name, a daily fee and a level of experience. Beginner workers can keep 60% of their fee and give the other 40% to the company to make it profitable. Medium-level workers keep 70% of their fees, whereas experts keep 80% of it.

Everyone may or may not work on any day of the week depending on whether they have a job that day or not. All workers earn money (= their fee) only if they have a job that day. Plumbers get a job with 80% chance, electricians with 90% and gas-fitters with 65%.

However, electricians and gas-fitters do dangerous work, so they need free days to stay fit and sharp. Each month, there is a week (7 days) when they are on holiday.
     
The company has expenses too. Plumbers and electricians have to buy new tools once in every month. (Let's assume that each month consists of 30 days.) The company pays 50.000Ft for  Beginners’ tools, medium-level worker’s 35.000 Ft, while experts’ tools cost 25.000 Ft.

Unfortunately, the company could not hire a secretary yet, so each day it is one of the workers who has to stay in the office to answer the phone. He can't work that day. The others must know the name of the guy who's in the office each day.

How much is the company's profit after 3 months?
